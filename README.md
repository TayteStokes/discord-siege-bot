# Discord Siege Bot ðŸ¤–

This is a small application built to bring into your own discord server to quickly look up player ranks and statistics for RainbowSix Siege.

This Discord Bot relies on commands to execute the script. Members of the discord server can use the two commands `!rank` or `!stats` followed with the name of the player they are wanting to look up.

## Preview

Here are screen shots of what the bot looks like when executed in the discord server.
